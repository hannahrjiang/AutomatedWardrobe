# Automated Wardrobe
Every day, we dwell on hundreds of trivial decisions that reduce our capacity to make well thought-out decisions in the future. Through this Automated Wardrobe, I chose to pinpoint one of my greatest sources of decision fatigue in the morning: picking an outfit. It targets the same reason why Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg wear essentially the same thing every day, but prioritizes style and my love for fashion. At a click of a button, it generates a random outfit and allows me to shuffle through clothing so I can get a head start on the more important decisions in my day.

See the app in action [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OCGHgDMp9tXbV8EPYtWm8bYpXfvm-Suc/view?usp=sharing)! (Will open link to Google Drive). 

# How to use
To add your own clothing, simply add your own photos to the "tops" and "bottoms" folders. Note that the photos must me in .png file format, or else the program won't be able to read them. Change the filepaths for the "tops" and "bottoms" folders, as well as the individual "next," "previous," and "random" button folders, so that they are correct for your computer.

Once the app has been run, press the top button (which reads "Good morning, let's choose an outfit!") to create a random outfit. If necessary, click the arrow keys to switch between tops and bottoms.
